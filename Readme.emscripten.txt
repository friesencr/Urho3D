This branch was branched from the 1.32 tag and has been modified to build a subset of the Urho3D library with emscripten for use in web browsers.

Much of the changes were borrowed from the AtomicRuntime github repository[1].
Anything taken from there were from files marked with the standard Urho license header text. Many thanks to the Atomic Game Engine developers!
